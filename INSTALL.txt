INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

There are two ways to install the script; one using the installer (which is recommended) and the other is installing it manually

/////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////USING THE INSTALLER///////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////

1. To use the installer, simply point your domain to http://yoursite.com/_install/
   Remember to replace "yoursite.com" with your site.

   If it is a subdirectory, point it to http://yoursite.com/subdirectory/_install/

2. Provide your database login details, that is, server (which is often localhost), database username,
   Database password and database name.

3. Once the script verifies that the credentials are valid, it will import an sql file (sql.sql) and create
   a database connection file (db.php) in lib/db/

   If you happen to make a mistake and the db file is written in the path provided above, simply delete it 
   and start  the reinstallation process. 

4. Lastly, in step two of the installation, provide site settings. These settings are important as the site 
   will not function without them. Provide the site url, that is, http://yoursite.com without the trailing front slash.
   Do provide a site title, default email address and select your timezone. Delete or rename the _install folder.

   That is it!!!


   It is worthwhile reminding you that the script does not have an admin section as of now but it will be released soon. 
   You can test the functionalities of the member area and make your suggestions or recommendations.

///////////MANUAL INSTALLATION////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////
To manually install this script, do the following

1. In _install folder, you will find a file named db_sample.php. Move it to "lib/db/" and rename it db.php 
   (that is, delete the _sample)
2. Fill in your database credentials by replacing localhost, my_database_name, my_database_username and my_database_password
   with your database details
3. Once that is done, go back to _install folder and using phpmyadmin, import the sql file (sql.sql). Alternatively, you can 
   open the sql file, copy all its content and in your phpmyadmin, choose SQL, paste it and execute.
4. Lastly, you will need to enter your site settings. These details should be entered in "site_settings" table in your database.
   From phpmyadmin, click on the table "site_settings", then click insert. Leave the id empty but fill in the site_url, site_title,
   site_email, theme and time_zone. For the site url, enter http://yoursite.com or http://yoursite.com/folder without a trailing front slash.
   For the theme, enter "default" without the quotes and in lowercase. Lastly, for the time_zone, use the format Africa/Nairobi.
  
   That is it!
