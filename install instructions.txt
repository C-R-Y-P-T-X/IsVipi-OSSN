INSTALLATION
==================================================================

1 - Create a database, a user and a password from cPanel or your host's cotrol panel

2 - Visit your site (http://yoursite.com). Since it is your first installation, it will automatically redirect
    you to the script software installation page. 

3 - Fill in your database credentials, the ones you created at step 1.

4 - Create an admin account and that is it

5 - You can choose to delete the install folder or leave it as it is. I wwould however recommend that you delete it because
    if someone knows that you are running the isvipi social networking script, he/she will most probable know where the install
    folder is located.
